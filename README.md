# gamedev

gamedev is a high school project between drumsetmonkey and tcsullivan written in C++ and using SDL2/OpenGL. The goal of this project is to have a completed commercial-grade video game available to Windows and Linux users. The game is planned to have a price, and once the game reaches its final stages it will become closed source (however, what was uploaded will stay for others to use as a resource).
