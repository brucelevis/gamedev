# gamedev


gamedev is a high school project between drumsetmonkey and tcsullivan written in C++ and using SDL2/OpenGL. The goal of this project is to have a completed commercial-grade video game available to Linux and Windows users. We plan on profiting off of the game once we finish it, so once the game reaches its final stages it may become closed source (however, what was uploaded will stay for others to use as a resource).
